# FACE-MASK-NAMES-DETECTION-AND-KEEPING-POSTED-THEM-TO-WEAR-MASK

In this project, we are going to build an algorithm such that the person who ever enters without wearing a mask will be sorted in real-time and the algorithm detects his face from organization data and his name will be shouted loudly and alerts him to wear his mask.

requirements:
python, cuda, cudnn

Steps:
1. Firstly, we capture images of persons each of 50 images for more accuracy (CaptureDataset.py)
